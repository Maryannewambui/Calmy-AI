## Implementation Steps

This project follows these key implementation steps:

1.  **Define the Problem and Scope:**
    * **Objective:** To develop an AI-powered web application that helps users understand and manage their stress and fatigue levels through personalized insights and recommendations.
    * **Target Users:** Individuals interested in proactively monitoring and improving their well-being, potentially early adopters of health technology.
    * **Key Metrics to Monitor:** Heart rate, voice levels, temperature levels

2.  **Data Collection:**
    * **Data Sources:** Currently utilizing simulated health data Future development will explore integration with APIs from wearable devices like Fitbit.
    * **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts handle data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, outliers) and normalization to prepare data for model training.

3.  **Model Selection:**
    * **Task:** Anomaly detection (identifying unusual health patterns) and health recommendation (providing personalized advice).
    * **Algorithms:**
        * **Random Forest:** Used for classification tasks, such as identifying normal vs. abnormal heart rate patterns.
        * **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Employed for analyzing time-series data to predict future trends in health metrics and potential fatigue buildup.
    * **Libraries:** scikit-learn for traditional machine learning, TensorFlow for deep learning models.

4.  **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * **Training:** Data is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split) to train the machine learning models. 
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.
    * **Cross-Validation:** Techniques like cross-validation are used to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data. 

5.  **Build a User Interface:**
    * **Platform:** A web application is being developed using Flask (Python microframework) for the backend and React ViteJS for the frontend 
    * **Features:**
        * Displaying real-time (simulated for now) health metrics.
        * Showing anomaly alerts and potential recommendations.
        * Providing historical data visualization through charts and graphs.

6.  **Deployment :**
    * **RENDER** - we'll deploy the backend and postgresql
    * **VERCEL** - We will deploy the frontend / UI/UX design for customer use on vercel **

7.  **Testing and Validation:**
    * **Unit Testing:** Individual components of the application (e.g., data preprocessing functions, model inference)
    * **Integration Testing:** Ensuring that different parts of the system work together correctly (e.g., data flow from simulated source to the AI model and to the web app).
    * **User Testing:** Future plans include collecting feedback from target users to improve the system's usability and effectiveness.

8.  **Documentation and Reporting:**
    * **Documentation:** This `README.md` provides an overview of the project.

    * **Presentation:** A pitch deck has been created to showcase the project.
